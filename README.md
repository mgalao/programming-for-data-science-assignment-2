# Programming for Data Science: Assignment 2

## Team Members
- Marco GalÃ£o
- Marta Boavida

## Submission Details
- **Platform**: Moodle
- **Deadline**: 18th October, 11:59 PM

## Assignment Overview
This repository contains the materials for our second assignment in the Programming for Data Science course. Our task is to solve a series of coding exercises.

## Assignment Guidelines
This homework assignment will test your capacity to **load and manipulate data with Pandas**.

The goal is to develop intuition on filtering, arranging, and merging data, which will be useful for the next homework assignment.
Fill the empty cells with your code and deliver a copy of this notebook to Moodle.

Your submission will be graded according to the following guidelines:

1. **Execution** (does your program does what is asked from the exercise?
2. **Objectivity** (are you using the adequate libraries? are you using a library ... )
3. **Readability** of your code (including comments, variables naming, supporting text, etc ...)

**Comment your code properly**, which includes naming your variables in a meaningful manner. **Badly documented code will be penalized**.

This assignment is to be done in pairs, and remember that you can't have the same pair from the previous and subsequent assignments.

**Students that are caught cheating will obtain a score of 0 points.**

Homework 2 is worth 25% of your final grade.

The submission package should correspond to a .zip archive (.rar files are not accepted) with the following files:

1. Jupyter Notebook with the output of all the cells;
2. HTML print of your Jupyter Notebook (in Jupyter go to File -> Download as -> HTML);
3. All text or .csv files that are exported as part of the exercises. **Please don't upload the files downloaded/imported as part of the exercises.**

**Please change the name of the notebook to "H2.<student_1_id>_<student_2_id>.ipynb", replacing <student_id> by your student_id.**

Submission is done through the respective Moodle activity, and only one of the group members should submit the files.

The deadline is the **19th of October at 12:00.**

A penalty of 1 point per day late will be applied to late deliveries.

**In this notebook, you are allowed to use Pandas and Numpy.**
